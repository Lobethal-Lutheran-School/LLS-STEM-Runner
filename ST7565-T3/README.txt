Forked from Adafruit ST7565 library.
This is a version for use with T4v2 transistor testers.

New sprites can be created with the utilities in the sprite-tools directory

Pinout definitions for the SPI data are contained in

stlcd.h

and can be modified for the various T3, T4, or T4v2 versions of the component tester

TODO:

simplify build options for the different hardware types
